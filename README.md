# Stock-Price-predictor
This is repo for the course project of the course GNR652 - Machine Learning for remote sensing, where we programmed an LSTM network for stock price prediction

Some modifications possible - 

Denoising the price signal to remove the stochastic component using wavelet denoising method

Increasing the data size by training an RCGAN on this dataset. For more information on this part, please check : https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02633
